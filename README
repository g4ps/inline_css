Little tool for making html's with inline styles


usage: python3 comp.py input_file style.evg output_file

input file should have attributes 'evg' which will be substituted according to attribute names is styles.evg

.evg files have sytax of
name_of_attr css_to_be_substituted #comment

that thing is primitive and probably could've been done much easier, but it was fun to make and it served me well
